# FindDuplicateImages
Simple terminal program to find duplicate images

I needed a simple program to find duplicate images in my photos directory.
So I created a quick program to run on the command line.

I use this to find exact matches of images I upload. Sometimes I am not sure if I already downloaded them so I just put it in a directory and let my program check if there is duplicates.
